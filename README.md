# My personal Dotfiles

for tmux nvim etc...

The main branch is for linux (also can be used on mac), the macOS branch have specific configs for mac (for example, neovide configs).

**July 5, 2023 update about Neovim Config**: though it looks out of date(with vimscript vim-plug and 'old' lsp config styles),
it still work out of the box after `:PlugInstall` in nvim v0.9.1.
This is my personal config I use daily, and will fix soon when braking changes happens(if ever).
The reason why I didn't migrate to 'newer' nvim stuff is because I use neovim not for the sake of just using it,
but for improving my productivity when coding and quick setup on any machine, regardless of the environment is updated or old.
This doesn't mean I never adapt newer feature,
if there's a need, I will do it, and maybe swith to lazy.vim and full lua config as well.
